I built `timeplease` - a Rust CLI for timezone conversions. 

This is my hand at building a CLI tool that solves a problem I have - getting time in different timezones while scheduling meetings.

## Usage

Current time anywhere:
```bash
timeplease current london
# Output: 2025-08-17 14:30:00 BST London
```

Convert between timezones:
```bash
timeplease convert 10:00 india london  
# Output: 10:00 IST India â†’ 05:30 BST London
```

## Tools I tried

- **Ghostty** for terminal 
- **Helix** editor
- Rust libraries: `chrono`, `clap`, `serde_json`

Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sriram13m/timeplease) - `cargo install timeplease`
